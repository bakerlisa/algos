1. stacks - like a stack of plates: last in first out
2. Queue - line at the DMV: first in first out

To be honest I can't come up with a reason why you'd use stacks. I'm sure there's a real life example but....other than dishes, students who come in late and sit in the back of the class, paperwork, pringles in a can, items on a shelf, 

most things in everyday life are queues.
