I wanted to keep the square root values paired with their coordinate values.Â That way I could sort them and then just add the coordinates to the returned array. It would also mean I would only be sorting once. Originally I thought to square root the values then check the, against the pervious most minimum value. But that was a bubble sort and those are very slow. by looping through and quickly getting the value we needed, then sorting them it broke the steps into 2 smaller steps that the computer could do faster.
